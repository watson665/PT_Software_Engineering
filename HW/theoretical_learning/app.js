Take some notes on these concepts and submit the file with the notes however you wish

1) Inversion of Control
IoC is a principal of Software Engineering. 
IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program.
In IoC, the control of the objects or a protion of a program is transferred to a container or framework.
To enable IoC, Frameworks use abstractions.
The Spring Container is the core of the Spring Framework. 
The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle.
Objects in Spring are called Spring Beans. 

2) Dependency Injection
Can be done by setter injection or constructor injection.

3) The MVC pattern
Model View Controller Framework is an architecture. 
Separates the application in to three logic components, Model - View - Controller.
Model: includes all the data and its related logic.
View: Presents data to the user or handles user interaction.
Controller: interface between Model and View components.

4) Spring Profiles
A tool in Spring for grouping configuration properties.
Default profile is always active.
Other profiles will be evaluated on top of the default profile.
