1. Why do you think Heinz made this change?
So that their customers could have a more user friendly way to get ketchup out of the bottle. As the ketchup is used it gets harder to get the ketchup out of the bottle in the old design versus the new design. The laws of gravity show that a more friendlier user experience would be to have the opening at the bottom of the bottle versus the top.

2. Discuss - How does this apply to web development?
Having a user friendly interface in web development is crucial because it can make or break how customers interact with the applications. A good user interface is imperative because it allows users to understand how to navigate without a lot of help or direction.

3. What's a site that you use all the time that has good UX?
YouTube
How is that site:
Goal Focused - The site allows you to search & watch videos based on the content that the user is looking for.
Invisible - The search bar is the first thing that you see when you go to the website; play/pause/ rewind buttons/ comments section are self- explanatory; and easy to navigate through.
Forgiving - If you make a mistake you can always fix it easily (deleting comment, subscrubing/unsubcribing to a channel, selecting a different video to watch).
Consistent - The pages are similar in layout.
Smooth Onboarding - When you go the site it's easy to figure out how to navigate through it without a lof of instructions.
